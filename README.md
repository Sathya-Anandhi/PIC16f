# PIC16f
Practice Code for PIC16F877A in C-language and Assembly Code.

Microcontroller -> PIC16F877A
IDE -> MPlab X IDE V5.45

I have created this repo to share my knowledge in Embedded Programming with Midrange Microchip PIC16FXXX Controllers.

Concepts added :) with example project.

I/O examples -> Timers -> Capture-Compare-PWM -> Inetrrupt -> ADC -> I2C -> SPI -> USART -> WATCH DOG TIMER.

Every topics have both C-lang and Assmebly Project files.
Also added Proteus Simulation Folder inside every Project file (in both Assembly and C) with Circuits designed,
which might be useful to visualize the output for less complex topics.

Hope it addes progress to your learning curve.

If you have any Request or Issues let me know.

Thank you.
